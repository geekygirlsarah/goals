# Goals
My goals for things I want to accomplish with my life. These will evolve over time. They're mostly for me to remind myself of things I'd like to see happen for myself.

After I was referred to a mentoring program and asked if it "met my volunteer goals," I stopped to think and realized that my time and energy and skillset are valuable. I want to spend them wisely and the most effectively. That is why I created this list.

## Personal Goals

* To grow as a person and become the best version of myself I can
* To care for people as much as I can
* To continue to learn as much as I can about software development
* To be a support person for those struggling with bad experiences that I can help them deal with
* To use my extra resources (time, money, energy, etc.) in the best ways I can to help others 
* To be open and honest with myself and others about the issues I have or am dealing with in order to foster communication about "taboo" subjects one shouldn't talk about
* To stretch myself to constantly go just a bit further outside of my comfort zone
* To learn to love myself, as I am, and with all of my flaws
* To learn to love my body the best I can
