# Goals
My goals for things I want to accomplish with my life. These will evolve over time. They're mostly for me to remind myself of things I'd like to see happen for myself.

After I was referred to a mentoring program and asked if it "met my volunteer goals," I stopped to think and realized that my time and energy and skillset are valuable. I want to spend them wisely and the most effectively. That is why I created this list.

(Note: this list is a subset of the main list. It only shows off speaking goals. See README.md for the whole list.)
